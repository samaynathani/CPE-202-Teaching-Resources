## üìñ Textbook   
[Textbook](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) - this is super helpful! The textbook contains a lot of working code for labs. If you ever get stuck or forget how a data structure works, this is how to get back on track. Feel free to check your lab code against the book or use it for hints since labs are for learning.

## ‚ùî FAQS  
**Q:** *How are assignments graded/ how did I get this score?*  
**A:** We use unit-tests to check all functions for correct output. If you would like to see which tests failed or feedback from the test cases, please send me (the TA) an email with the name of the assignment and your Github ID.    

**Q:** *How do I get better scores on assignments?*  
**A:** When writing tests, make sure to test assignment REQUIREMENTS listed in the spec, and NOT just the code you have written (code coverage). Getting 100% coverage itself is not enough to guarantee an A on an assignment.  

**Q:** *How do I write better test cases?*  
**A:** Be sure to write tests for edge-cases (empty strings, empty arrays, None objects, negative numbers, zeros, repeated values in arrays, etc). Be sure to test different states of classes & data structures you implement (empty, full, contains items but not at capacity, exception handling, etc).      

**Q:** *How should I prepare for the miderm?*  
**A:** Be able to write any function from any lab, know all time complexities (worst, best, average), understand how to draw and step through different data structures, know postfix and prefix notation.    

**Q:** *I'm stuck on a problem, how should I proceed?*  
**A:** 1. Re-read the instructions  
2. Draw the data structure and manually walk through a few sample cases for the problem/ function  
3. convert the above logic to pseudo-code  
4. convert the pseudo-code to Python code  
5. Test and use the debugger if you  run into errors  
6. repeat steps 3-5 until your function works  
7. If you are still stuck, the textbook contains a lot of helpful tips, explanations, and sample code for functions. Good luck!  

## üòÑ Topic Hints
### Recursion
1. Always have a base-case, recursive call, and way to bring each recursive call closer to the base-case
2. If you are missing any of those things, you might get stuck in an infinite loop
3. You can put the recursive portion of your code into a helper function to improve simplicity and handle invalid inputs/ edge cases in the caller-function  

### Stacks
1. For array-based implementations, think about the relationship between the number of items it contains and how to access the topmost element.
2. For linked-list implementations, adding and removing from the head is the same as the "top".
3. Time complexities - push/ pop - O(1), size - O(1), pop all/ push all - O(n).

### Queues
1. For array-based implementations, think about the relationship between the front, rear, and how you can use the capacity to wrap-around.
2. For linked-list implementations, think about the front and rear node lists as 2 stacks.  
3. **Important!** for linked-list implementations, dequeue must be O(1) in the AVERAGE case. Our worst case is O(n) (a loop is okay if used in the worst case).
4. Time complexities - push/ pop - O(1), size - O(1), pop all/ push all - O(n).

### Double-Linked List
1. The sentinal node marks both the front and end of the list. If the sentinal node points to itself, the list is empty. 
2. The sentinal node contains no (significant) value.
3. This list must be ordered. You can use the less-than (<) operator for comparing values.
